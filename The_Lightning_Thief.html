		"Percy Jackson and the Olympians" is a captivating
		novel series written by American author Rick Riordan. 
		The series follows the adventures of Percy Jackson,
		a young demigod who discovers his extraordinary heritage
		as the son of Poseidon, the Greek god of the sea.
		</p>
		<p>
		The novels have gained immense popularity among readers
		of all ages, thanks to Riordan's engaging storytelling and
		the fascinating blend of Greek mythology and modern-day settings. 
		The series takes place in a world where the Greek gods exist in
		the 21st century and explores Percy's journey as he navigates
		the challenges of being a demigod.
		</P>
		<p>
		The success of the book series led to the creation of two movies
		based on the first two novels: "Percy Jackson & the Olympians: The
		Lightning Thief" (2010) and "Percy Jackson: Sea of Monsters" (2013).
		</p>
		<p>
		As Percy navigates the world of gods and monsters, he embarks on a quest
		to prevent a war among the gods by recovering Zeus' stolen lightning bolt.
		Along the way, Percy encounters mythical creatures, forms friendships with
		other demigods, and uncovers shocking truths about his own identity.
