		"The Titan's Curse" is the third installment in the captivating
		"Percy Jackson & the Olympians" series penned by Rick Riordan. 
		Building upon the previous adventures of Percy Jackson, a young
		demigod and son of Poseidon, this book takes readers on an exhilarating
		journey filled with danger, mythology, and self-discovery.
		</p>
		<p class="titan">
		The story begins when Percy and his friends, Annabeth and Thalia,
		set out on a mission to rescue the goddess Artemis, who has been
		captured by a mysterious foe. As they delve deeper into the quest,
		they uncover a dangerous plot orchestrated by the malevolent Titan
		lord Kronos, who seeks to overthrow the gods of Olympus.
		</p>
		<p class="titan">
		Along their treacherous path, Percy and his companions encounter a
		multitude of mythological creatures, face perilous challenges, and
		form new alliances with both mortal and immortal beings. They must
		navigate through intricate webs of deceit, confront their own doubts
		and insecurities, and unravel the secrets of the Titan's curse in order
		to save Artemis and prevent Kronos from rising to power.
		</p>
		<p class="titan">
		As the stakes heighten, the story delves into the complexities of
		friendship, loyalty, and the personal growth of the characters. 
		Percy's unwavering determination, Annabeth's strategic brilliance,
		and Thalia's unwavering spirit shine through as they face overwhelming
		odds and make difficult choices. New characters are introduced, each
		with their own unique abilities and backstories, further enriching the
		narrative and adding layers of depth to the overarching plot.
